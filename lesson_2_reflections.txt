What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository a hidden directory .git is created which stores all the metadata.
We create a reposirory so that we can keep track of our files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area offers more control to us, it allow us to select files which we want to commit we can eliminate the other files which we dont want to commit.
