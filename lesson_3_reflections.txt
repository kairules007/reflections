When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all you work local?
      We would like to use a remote reposirory rather than keeping our work local when we are working on some project which require
      contribution from multiple people and multiple people want to accsess and change files.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	We might want to pull the changes manually so that we are always aware that a new commit has been created by someone, so when
	we pull changes manually we are mentally aware that some changes has been made into the project and we can check those changes 
	out, if the changes were pull automatically we always have to aware of any changes manually and it will be trouble for us we
	see a file which we have not created because we were not mentally aware that when the file was pulled into our system.
